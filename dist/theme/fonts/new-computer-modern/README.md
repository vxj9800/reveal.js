# The LATEX Style Fonts #

These fonts are downloaded from https://www.ctan.org/pkg/newcomputermodern. Only a subset of font styles, specifically NewCM10 type, is copied here to reduce the space required. There are three styles, Serif (NewCM10), Monospaced (NewCMMono10) and Sans-Serif (NewCMSans10). All three styles contain bold, bold-italic, italic and regular type of fonts.
